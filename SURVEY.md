## Stub for survey questions.  

There will probably  be some options for response, i.e paragraph, yes/no,
etc.

We want to do some research on making good survey questions, and what other
surveys are out there that we can learn from.

### Racial Identification
Allowing people to check all labels with which they identify would be good.

### Position
Should we allow people to choose all labels which describe their job, or limit them to n?
