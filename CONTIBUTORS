Who, Why
@drnikki, I believe that it is vital to our health as a tech community
@nstiielau, I think this will encourage conversations and make a difference
@imtiffanyyu, passionate about inclusion and empowerment
@rachel_norfolk, I find it is the diversity in the people that I meet that makes life interesting. We should celebrate this diversity, not feel it is a chore to consider.
@thenyouDi, I live by the motto "Nothing about us wuthout us!"
