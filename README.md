# Diversity of the Web
## A discussion about diversity in the web-development community

An initiative to publish information, raw data, and insights on the diversity
of the web world based on a community-drafted survey, hoping to increase
visibility about existing under-representation and encourage conversations about
increasing diversity.

Authored by the community, at
https://github.com/drnikki/diversity-survey

## Goals

Our primary goal is to drive awareness and discussion about diversity and
inclusivity in the web-development community.  We'll be doing amazing if we get: 

* 10,000 unique responses
* 1,000 Github stars
* 100 Collaborators

## WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW

* People to support (tweet, star on github)
* People interested in helping author (github PRs, issues)
* Companies with email lists willing to support and promote the survey (when ready)

## Survey Participants:
Anyone who identifies with ‘moving the web forward’ or ‘making the internet’.
This includes roles like sysadmin, project manager, shop owner, designer, UX,
etc.  Possible problems: skewing the data with ‘content editors’ or ‘copywriters’

## Timeline
Here's what we're hoping to do:

* Summer '16: Drafy
* September '16: Finalize Draft
* October '16: Release survey
* November '16: Wait for results, promote
* December '16: Collect results, publish, event to analyze

## Allies
* Pantheon (Nick Stielau)
* Drupal Diversity and Inclusion (Nikki Stevens)

## Simple ways to Fail:
* Not doing it at all
* No one is leading/driving it
* Leading/biased questions
* Data Integrity issues (i.e. multiple responses from same person)

## How to Contribute
* Star the github repo to show your support!
* Tweet/reweet to help promote!
* Fork and PR!
* Contact @drnikki or @nstielau
* Simply have converstations about diversity, why it's important, and how we can improve it!

*If you want to contribute, but don't have a github account or are uncomfortable with the github contribution process, please reach out to Nikki in any of the following ways: @drnikki on twitter, the drupal slack channel and IRC or shoot an email to nikki@drnikki.org and we can figure out an accessible way for you to help!*

## Oops! / Ouch! Policy
Talking about diversity can be hard, but we believe talking is first step for
improvement.  As such, we need some room to make mistakes, and to give clear
feedback when a discussion/approach/idea/term is hurtful.  Say 'Oops!' if you
catch yourself on potentially offensive territory, and 'Ouch!' if you feel
offended.  Thanks!
